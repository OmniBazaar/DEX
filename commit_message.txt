feat(dex): Create comprehensive test suite for DEX functionality (tests not yet run)

## Test Files Created
- Add DEXRegistry.test.ts for registry management tests
- Add OrderBook.test.ts for order matching tests  
- Add UniswapV3Integration.test.ts for AMM integration tests
- Add DydxIntegration.test.ts for perpetual trading tests
- Add 11 UI component test files in Bazaar module
- Add service and integration test files
- Add security and E2E test files
- Create TEST_PLAN.md outlining test strategy

## IMPORTANT: Tests Status
- All test files have been WRITTEN but NOT EXECUTED
- Tests need to be run with appropriate test runners
- Tests likely need debugging and fixes to pass
- Code may need updates based on test results

## Documentation Updates  
- Update DEX_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md to reflect test files created
- Update CURRENT_STATUS.md to show tests written but not run
- Update TODO.md with accurate test status

## Next Steps Required
1. Set up test environment and dependencies
2. Run tests with Jest (TypeScript) and Hardhat (Solidity)
3. Debug and fix failing tests
4. Update code to make tests pass
5. Validate test coverage metrics

The test suite provides a comprehensive testing framework,
but requires execution and validation before production deployment.
